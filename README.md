# Quora Insincere Question Classification
A problem today for major websites is, how to handle toxic and divisive content?
Quora is a platform that empowers people to learn from each other. On Quora, people can ask questions and connect with others who contribute unique insights and quality answers. A key challenge is to remove insincere questions, those founded upon false premises, or that intend to make a statement rather than look for helpful answers.
In this Project we developed models that identify and flag insincere questions. With this model, Quora can develop more scalable methods to detect toxic and misleading content.

## Algorithms Used:

In this we have used 3 approches:
### 1.XGBoost: 
This is the one of the most popularly used algorithm. It is high speed-high performance model. This was selected since it is known to be efficient, accurate and feasible.
### 2. Naive Bayes Classifier
Naive Bayes is a simple technique for constructing classifiers: models that assign class labels to problem instances, represented as vectors of feature values, where the class labels are drawn from some finite set.
### 3. 



After evaluating differnt approches found out that the best accuracy is achieved by ----------- algorithm.

### Tools Required: 
Anaconda -  Jupyter Notebook, MS Excel

### Setup
We have used the Anaconda distribution for downloading all required packages and creating virtual environment. You can use pip for your purposes. For a proper execution of code, Python version 3.6.6 is needed. Ideally any version above 3.6.6 should also work.
